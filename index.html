                    <strong>The basics: What <em>is</em> cybersecurity?</strong><br>
                    Cybersecurity is the way individual people and organisations try to remove the risk of being affected by some kind of cybercrime.
                    Basically, cybersecurity exists to help protect the devices we use (e.g. smartphones, laptops and computers) and the services we access online.
                    It's also about protecting the personal information we store on these devices and online.
                    Since technologies like smartphones and the internet are now a fundamental part of society,
                    it's more important than ever to prevent cyber criminals from taking our accounts, data and devices.
