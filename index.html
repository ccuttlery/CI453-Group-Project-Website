                    We are surrounded by technology, it is used in both our daily lives and work lives.
                    With this being said, there are countless modern businesses which uses technology such as <strong> IBM,
                    Microsoft, Google, Schools, Sony</strong>, <strong>and a lot more</strong>. While technology comes with certain benefits
                    which allows businesses to efficiently be productive, it has also exposed businesses to certain
                    vulnerabilities which left unchecked, can cause vital damage. This website will teach you security
                    Mechanisms which helps defends businesses using technology against vulnerabilities.

                    <strong>The basics: What <em>is</em> cybersecurity?</strong><br>
                    Cybersecurity is the way individual people and organisations try to remove the risk of being affected by some kind of cybercrime.
                    Basically, cybersecurity exists to help protect the devices we use (e.g. smartphones, laptops and computers) and the services we access online.
                    It's also about protecting the personal information we store on these devices and online.
                    Since technologies like smartphones and the internet are now a fundamental part of society,
                    it's more important than ever to prevent cyber criminals from taking our accounts, data and devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How do I stay secure?</strong><br>
                    The National Cyber Security Center has determined six "cyber aware" actions you can take to stay secure online.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use a strong password for your email.</li>
                        <li>Install the latest software and app updates.</li>
                        <li>Turn on 2-Step Verification (2SV).</li>
                        <li>Use a password manager.</li>
                        <li>Back up your data.</li>
                        <li>Create strong passwords out of three random words.</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>
                    When working with hardware or software, whether it be for school, work, or entertainment, it is crucial to keep everything protected. This includes your hardware, software, and importantly, yourself. <br>
                    Below are various security mechanisms used by businesses to protect their information, physical computers, and networks. <br>

                            <h2>Access Control</h2> 
                            <p>The management of access to network and information systems. Which users can access data or services and those that can are appropriately verified, authenticated and authorised.<br>It is imperative that an organisation is clear about who authorisation to interact with network and information systems supporting an essential function in any way or access associated sensitive data.<br>Rights granted should be carefully controlled, especially when those rights provide an ability to materially affect the operation of an essential function. Its like a printer room at a school, only teachers and those with passes are allowed to access the printers, but only the IT department are allowed to change the printer functions. This is done so that everything is done as efficiently as possible.<br>These rights should also be reviewed periodically and removed when no longer required. E.g. once a student has used the printers using their pass, they give the pass back to the teacher and therefore no longer have access to the printer room. From a business standpoint, this might be when an individual leaves the organisation.<br><br>Users, devices, and systems should all be verified and reviewed so that nothing unwanted has attached itself to anything.</p>

                            <h2>Confidentiality</h2> 
                            <p>The ability to protect data so that unauthorised parties cannot view the data. Confidentiality is like a secret a friend tells you. You now posses confidential information about them. It is your duty to protect the confidentiality so that no one else knows. <br>In business, this data typically consists of:</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li>Personal data: national insurance numbers, full names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, credit card numbers, etc.</li>
                            	<li>Trade secrets: customer and supplier lists, source codes, processes, inventions, etc.</li>
                            	<li>Other resitricted business data: unpublished financial information.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Confidentiality is to ensure that private data, such as those listed above, are protected against unauthorised access, disclosure without permission, and theft. <br>The biggest enemy to confidentiality are data breaches, which are extremely dangerous for businesses, causing significant financial losses and reputational damage. Like letting the secret about your friend slip, it may ruin their reputation in the school (not nice). <br><br>Business imploy methods to ensure data confidentiality such as restricting data.<br>Only certain individuals in the organisation have access to this high value private data. This reduces the probability of a random slip up from any number of the organisations employees.<br>Other ways include the encryption of data (so when transferring it cannot be understood by anyone without a key), implementing a confidentiality policy/devlopment and implementation of a cybersecurity program (ensures employees understand how to handle confidential data so it doesn't end up in the wrong hands), physical security measures (alarm systems, surveillance cameras etc.) and non-disclosure agreements (a contract that states the individuals who recieve confidential data, such as stakeholders, will not disclose the information).</p>

                            <h2>Authentication</h2> 
                            <p>The process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process.<br><br>Why do we authenticate? Its important to make sure someone or something is who they say they are before allowing them to do what they will. In the same way its good to check the person at the door is who they claim to be by looking at them through the peephole. You don't want anyone to be able to access your things incase they steal or damage them in any way. In the computing world, we call this User Authentication. It is the main method for protecting access to devices and the data stored on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. It also protects against unwanted changes (e.g. administrator settings on windows).<br><br>Businesses will use something called CDS (cross domain solutions) to authenticate all users, equipment, and internal component connection sessions before use of any systems. <br>User authentication is important so our data isn't stolen or tampered with.<br>Equipment authentication is important so that any virus carrying or tampered with equipment cannot access our data.<br>Components within the CDS are authenticated to each other, ensuring the flow of data and authorisations within the system are as intended.<br><br>Various authentication methods can be used depending on what service is being accessed and by what, each method having its own strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Its important for businesses to consider both the security and usability of their devices and services. If they implement the most secure system ever created, but it takes users too long to access, then the security mechanism is pointless, as it cannot be easily accessed by trusted users.<br><br>Attackers look to target weaknesses in authentication systems. Many common attacks look for simple ways to guess or steal user device credentials.<br>With these credentials, attackers can impersonate valid users and devices, gaining access to valuables (e.g. data), and the ability to connect remotely to enterprise services, using this foothold to penetrate further into corporate networks.<br>Given these potential consequences, it should be clear that implementing effecting authentication is essential for organisations wishing to protect against account, device or netowrk compromise.</p>
