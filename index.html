                <p>
                    We are surrounded by technology, it is used in both our daily lives and work lives.
                    With this being said, there are countless modern businesses which uses technology such as <strong> IBM,
                    Microsoft, Google, Schools, Sony</strong>, <strong>and a lot more</strong>. While technology comes with certain benefits
                    which allows businesses to efficiently be productive, it has also exposed businesses to certain
                    vulnerabilities which left unchecked, can cause vital damage. This website will teach you security
                    Mechanisms which helps defends businesses using technology against vulnerabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The basics: What <em>is</em> cybersecurity?</strong><br>
                    Cybersecurity is the way individual people and organisations try to remove the risk of being affected by some kind of cybercrime.
                    Basically, cybersecurity exists to help protect the devices we use (e.g. smartphones, laptops and computers) and the services we access online.
                    It's also about protecting the personal information we store on these devices and online.
                    Since technologies like smartphones and the internet are now a fundamental part of society,
                    it's more important than ever to prevent cyber criminals from taking our accounts, data and devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How do I stay secure?</strong><br>
                    The National Cyber Security Center has determined six "cyber aware" actions you can take to stay secure online.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use a strong password for your email.</li>
                        <li>Install the latest software and app updates.</li>
                        <li>Turn on 2-Step Verification (2SV).</li>
                        <li>Use a password manager.</li>
                        <li>Back up your data.</li>
                        <li>Create strong passwords out of three random words.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
            <h3>Assets</h3>
        		<p>
        			An asset can be many things, a major application, an item of value to stakeholders, it can be tangible (servers that house their data) or non-tangible (the data itself). Regardless of what the asset is, an asset is always something that is considered highly valuable to a business. <br>In the cases present on this web page, an asset could be user data, something the business values highly and doesn't want others to be able to access it outside of their company.<br><br>Assets can change over time and there should be constant reviews of the company to see what their most valuable assets are so they know where to focus their security.

                <p>
                    When working with hardware or software, whether it be for school, work, or entertainment, it is crucial to keep everything protected. This includes your hardware, software, and importantly, yourself. <br>
                    Below are various security mechanisms used by businesses to protect their information, physical computers, and networks. <br>

                                <h2>Access Control</h2> 
                                <p>The management of access to network and information systems. Which users can access data or services and those that can are appropriately verified, authenticated and authorised.<br>It is imperative that an organisation is clear about who authorisation to interact with network and information systems supporting an essential function in any way or access associated sensitive data.<br>Rights granted should be carefully controlled, especially when those rights provide an ability to materially affect the operation of an essential function. Its like a printer room at a school, only teachers and those with passes are allowed to access the printers, but only the IT department are allowed to change the printer functions. This is done so that everything is done as efficiently as possible.<br>These rights should also be reviewed periodically and removed when no longer required. E.g. once a student has used the printers using their pass, they give the pass back to the teacher and therefore no longer have access to the printer room. From a business standpoint, this might be when an individual leaves the organisation.<br><br>Users, devices, and systems should all be verified and reviewed so that nothing unwanted has attached itself to anything.</p>

                                <p>The ability to protect data so that unauthorised parties cannot view the data. Confidentiality is like a secret a friend tells you. You now posses confidential information about them. It is your duty to protect the confidentiality so that no one else knows. <br>In business, this data typically consists of:</p>
                                <ul>
                                	<li>Personal data: national insurance numbers, full names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, credit card numbers, etc.</li>
                                	<li>Trade secrets: customer and supplier lists, source codes, processes, inventions, etc.</li>
                                	<li>Other restricted business data: unpublished financial information.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Confidentiality is to ensure that private data, such as those listed above, are protected against unauthorised access, disclosure without permission, and theft. <br>The biggest enemy to confidentiality are data breaches, which are extremely dangerous for businesses, causing significant financial losses and reputational damage. Like letting the secret about your friend slip, it may ruin their reputation in the school (not nice). <br><br>Businesses employ methods to ensure data confidentiality such as restricting data.<br>Only certain individuals in the organisation have access to this high value private data. This reduces the probability of a random slip up from any number of the organisations employees.<br>Other ways include the encryption of data (so when transferring it cannot be understood by anyone without a key), implementing a confidentiality policy/development and implementation of a cybersecurity program (ensures employees understand how to handle confidential data so it doesn't end up in the wrong hands), physical security measures (alarm systems, surveillance cameras etc.) and non-disclosure agreements (a contract that states the individuals who receive confidential data, such as stakeholders, will not disclose the information).</p>

                                <h2>Encryption</h2> 
                                <p>The NCSC defines encryption as: “Protection of information by making it unreadable by everyone except those with the key to decrypt it.” <br> More specifically, an encryption algorithm uses a key - which is usually a random string of characters - to encode data or a message, making it unreadable until it is decrypted again. <br> Encryption DOESN’T stop someone from intercepting a message, it just prevents them from understanding it.<br> There are a lot of different times encryption might be used:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When sending sensitive information across the internet. Any website that says ‘https’ and all modern iOS and Android apps all use encryption to send data.</li>
                                    <li>When storing sensitive information on a mobile device such as a laptop. Since it could potentially be easily stolen, encrypting this data and locking it behind a username and password makes it unreadable to any potential thief.</li>
                                    <li>TV transmissions may use encryption to prevent users who do not have a subscription from watching certain TV shows.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Physical Security</h2> 
                                <p>The NCSC defines physical security as: “Protecting the places where people work, and the locations of systems, services and networks.” <br> This is a broad security mechanism that aims to protect from a range of threats such as fire, flooding, theft, vandalism and terrorism. Good physical security relies on three main things:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Access Control<br> Described more in-depth <a href="#SM1" style="text-decoration: none">here.</a> But specifically for physical security access control may also include infrastructure that defends against environmental threats and natural disasters e.g. walls/barriers to defend against earthquakes, floods, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Surveillance<br> Surveillance technology such as CCTV cameras can be helpful in not only providing evidence and capturing criminal behaviour but also in stopping it preemptively. (People are far less likely to break into a building if they see obvious cameras).</li>
                                    <li>Testing<br> Testing is an important part of physical security too. In order to know how well a company can respond to or stop a threat they have to do tests. An example of this could be something as simple as a fire drill, or as complex as specific tests on a company’s policies and plans in case of some sort of disaster.</li>

                                <h2>Authentication</h2> 
                                <p>The process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process.<br><br>Why do we authenticate? Its important to make sure someone or something is who they say they are before allowing them to do what they will. In the same way its good to check the person at the door is who they claim to be by looking at them through the peephole. You don't want anyone to be able to access your things incase they steal or damage them in any way. In the computing world, we call this User Authentication. It is the main method for protecting access to devices and the data stored on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. It also protects against unwanted changes (e.g. administrator settings on windows).<br><br>Businesses will use something called CDS (cross domain solutions) to authenticate all users, equipment, and internal component connection sessions before use of any systems. <br>User authentication is important so our data isn't stolen or tampered with.<br>Equipment authentication is important so that any virus carrying or tampered with equipment cannot access our data.<br>Components within the CDS are authenticated to each other, ensuring the flow of data and authorisations within the system are as intended.<br><br>Various authentication methods can be used depending on what service is being accessed and by what, each method having its own strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Its important for businesses to consider both the security and usability of their devices and services. If they implement the most secure system ever created, but it takes users too long to access, then the security mechanism is pointless, as it cannot be easily accessed by trusted users.<br><br>Attackers look to target weaknesses in authentication systems. Many common attacks look for simple ways to guess or steal user device credentials.<br>With these credentials, attackers can impersonate valid users and devices, gaining access to valuables (e.g. data), and the ability to connect remotely to enterprise services, using this foothold to penetrate further into corporate networks.<br>Given these potential consequences, it should be clear that implementing effecting authentication is essential for organisations wishing to protect against account, device or network compromise.</p>

                                <h2>Firewall</h2> 
                                <p>When it comes to businesses implementing an effective cyber security strategy. Having a firewall can make a huge contribution to this. A firewall can be thought of as a protective force field, keeping a businesses’ internal network infrastructure safe from any external attacks which may cause harm to that network infrastructure. How firewalls normally works is they will monitor ingoing and outgoing network traffic based typically on pre-defined security rules. The main goals for using a firewall is to prevent any data breaches, unauthorized access, malware infections and any other form of cyber security attacks. <br> There are a lot of advantages for businesses using a firewall:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A firewall acts as an extra layer to network security through the use of inspecting and filtering network traffic in order to defend against cyber security attacks. This works by detecting and blocking any suspicious activity, preventing any unauthorised access. </li>
                                    <li>Businesses are also able to use firewall for even multiple purposes as well. Most modern firewalls nowadays has built in advanced threat detection systems such as an intrusion detection system and malware detection systems as. Overall, businesses are able to use firewalls for multiple purposes which can go beyond the scope of just network trafficking. </li>
                                    <li>Businesses are able to use firewalls to determine access policies. This allows users to be restricted to have access on only the resources they need within the network. This helps to prevent data leaks and any unauthorized access to sensitive information. </li>
                                    <li>It is thanks to firewalls being able to track network traffic, businesses are able to have better insight on their network patterns which allows them to identify any vulnerabilities and security gaps. This can even help businesses to make decisions regarding how they can further strengthen their own cyber security infrastructure. </li>

                                <p>Data breaches is where sensitive information is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or accessed by an unauthorized individual This sensitive information can be financial information, trade secrets, or intellectual property. <br> As the internet grows, so does cyber crime which also means  data breaches as well. These data breaches can occur through many reasons such as a system having certain vulnerabilities, users using SQL injection software or spyware, people being tricked by certain social engineering techniques such as phishing, insecure passwords made by users, and many other factors. <br> Data breaches can result in identity theft, loss of sensitive information or even financial lost Stolen data can end up in a variety of places and can have many uses. Information such as personally identifiable information can end up on the dark web. <br> Data breaches can also be used to further help cyber criminals as well. For example, cyber criminals can often use old login credentials which was used in a data breach to trick users into thinking their account has been hacked and then further use social engineering methods such as phishing to gain access to new login credentials. <br> There are many examples of data breaches happening, one of the biggest examples of a data breach is Yahoo who was compromised by a group of hackers which also caused one billion accounts to be compromised. <br> Data breaches cannot be stopped simply by one security product or control. Data breaches can be reduced through common sense security as well as prevention practices.</p>

                                <h2>Social Engineering</h2> 
                                <p>There are some cyber security attacks which simply rely on the good will of people to trick them, this is known as social engineering techniques. Social engineering is manipulating individuals or even companies to give criminals their personal information. There are many different kinds of social engineering techniques which criminals use. Typical social engineering techniques include: <br></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Phishing</b>- Phishing attacks are social engineering techniques which involve social engineers sending carefully worded emails while seeming like a trustworthy source. This can be for example someone pretending to be associated with a bank in order to steal personal bank details. The intention behind phishing attacks is to lure people into clicking a URL link, PDF file, or other similar attachments which will cause personal information to be sent to the social engineer. Phishing attacks do not only occur through email but they can also be through social media posts and even message services. </li>
                                    <li><b>Social Networking</b>Social networking is social engineers using social networks to gain financial information from people by pretending to be a friend or relative. Social engineers also use social networking techniques to use a person’s public information against them such as their like and interests to create targeted malware embedded messages. A user clicking on these infected messages, tweets, or links can cause devastating impacts which can put a person’s personal information at risk.</li>
                                    <li><b>Telephone</b>There are social engineers who will contact people to trick into getting their personal information over the phone. The intention behind social engineers doing this is to persuade these victims to carry out tasks such as visiting a certain website, downloading documents, or carrying out updates to get malware on their device. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>There are many other social engineering attacks which can happen as well but these are typically the most common ones which can happen. </p>

                                <h2>How businesses Use Security Mechanisms</h2> 
                                <p>Most businesses these days use computers for one reason or another in their daily work. It is important that these computers are secure, as well as the users using them.</p>
                                <h4>1. Secure Systems</h4>
                                <p>The first step in a business staying secure is ensuring that their networks are protected. This includes implementing <b>NETWORK SECURITY INFORMATION HERE</b> as well as introducing a strong firewall. This will ensure that data is protected from outside intereference and assets remain uninfected.</p>
                                <h4>2. Secure Employees</h4>
                                <p>Ensuring all employees are trained in cyber security and are routinely checked is a major part in keeping a business secure. This is done so that the risk of a social engineering/phishing attacks are signifcantly reduced, and that also allows the company to be able to feel safer knowing their employees are ready for such events.</p>
                                <h4>3. Access Control</h4>
                                <p>Access control plays a major role in keeping a business secure. It allows for more secure data to be less accessible by any potential breaches. Authentication falls under the same category here, ensuring that all users need to be authenticated will also increase the efficacy of security.</p>
                                <h4>4. Physical Security</h4>
                                <p>Ensuring that physical servers and computers are in an otherwise inaccessible location from anyone is important. Physical security of all network connected devices is essential in mitigating risks such as an attacker getting access to a phone that is directly connected to the network systems. </p>
                                <h4>5. Private Communications</h4>
                                <p>When dealing with other businesses or moving around data, it is essential to have a private communications network, as well as encryptions to ensure that any data that may be leaked, is as impossible to decipher as possible.</p>
                                <br><p>Doing all of these steps will significantly increase the cyber security of any business.</p>
